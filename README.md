# React Native Asynchronous State Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving asynchronous operations and state updates. The problem arises when trying to update the component's state with data fetched from an API before the asynchronous operation completes, leading to a brief display of `null` or `undefined` before the correct data is shown.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file contains a React Native component that fetches data from a JSONPlaceholder API endpoint using the `fetch` API. The `useState` hook is used to manage the component's state, and the `useEffect` hook is used to fetch the data when the component mounts. However, the `setData` function is called before the `fetch` API call is complete, causing the state to briefly show `null` before it's updated with the actual data.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to correctly handle the asynchronous operation and update the state using the data fetched from the API. The solution involves checking if the data is available before attempting to render it, and also using a loading indicator to enhance the user experience while the data is being fetched.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`) to run the application.
5. Observe the brief display of `null` in the component before the actual data is loaded (in `bug.js`).
6. Compare this with the improved behavior in `bugSolution.js` which handles the loading state gracefully.
